Adds opt-in query instrumentation for performance regression testing. Setting `EMDASH_QUERY_LOG=1` causes the Kysely log hook to emit `[emdash-query-log]`-prefixed NDJSON on stdout for every DB query executed inside a request, tagged with the route, method, and an `X-Perf-Phase` header value. Zero runtime overhead when the flag is unset — the log option is only attached to Kysely when enabled.

Also exposes the helpers at `emdash/database/instrumentation` so first-party adapters (e.g. `@emdash-cms/cloudflare`) can wire the same hook into their per-request Kysely instances.
